                My name is Justin Nguyen and I am a 3rd year student studying computer science at Cal Poly Pomona. I am interested 
                in how computer science can further impact the world more than it already has. Prior to entering university, my perspective 
                was that of a consumer of technology rather than a contributor of it. However, entering this field made me realize the 
                extensive opportunities computer science can offer across different global sectors.
